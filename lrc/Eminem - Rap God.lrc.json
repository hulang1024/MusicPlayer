  "lyric": "[00:01.80]Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings[00:05.44]But I'm only going to get this one chance(Six minutes, six minutes)[00:10.02]Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)[00:13.06]Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what[00:18.45]If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble – and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances[00:25.32]You were just what the doctor ordered[00:26.66]I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God[00:29.77]All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod[00:32.91]Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?[00:36.16]They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot[00:38.62]But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes[00:40.82]I got a laptop in my back pocket[00:42.58]My pen'll go off when I half cock it[00:44.17]Got a fat knot from that rap profit[00:45.64]Made a living and a killing off it[00:47.03]Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office[00:48.63]With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack[00:50.53]I'm an MC still as honest[00:52.01]But as rude and indecent as all hell[00:53.42]Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)[00:55.16]This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop[00:56.54]You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap[00:59.08]Packing a mack in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack[01:02.04]And at the exact same time[01:03.76]I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that[01:05.08]I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table[01:06.86]Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half[01:08.55]Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact[01:12.10]How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack[01:15.31]Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxi-Pad[01:16.86]It's actually disastrously bad for the wack[01:19.16]while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah[01:22.00]Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God[01:24.84]All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod[01:28.01]Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?[01:31.25]Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard[01:34.50]Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got[01:37.82]Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance[01:40.63]Everybody loves to root for a nuisance[01:43.78]Hit the earth like an asteroid, and did nothing but shoot for the moon since (PPEEYOOM)[01:45.62]MC's get taken to school with this music[01:47.38]Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bus the rhyme'[01:48.44]Now I lead a new school full of students[01:55.88]Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-W-A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim[01:56.84]Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and being in a position[01:59.72]To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'[02:03.26]Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames[02:07.02]Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame[02:09.34]On the wall of shame[02:10.55]You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames[02:13.61]Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?[02:16.62]Little gay looking boy[02:17.81]So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy[02:19.85]You witnessing a massacre[02:21.08]Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy[02:23.21]Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy[02:26.43]You get a thumbs up, pat on the back[02:27.88]And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy[02:29.58]Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?[02:31.22]I got a \"hell yeah\" from Dre looking boy[02:32.80]I'mma work for everything I have[02:34.26]Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy[02:36.05]Basically boy you're never gonna be capable[02:38.08]To keep up with the same pace looking boy[02:39.39]Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God[02:42.66]All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod[02:45.82]The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar[02:49.02]Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God[02:51.78]Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard[02:55.50]So you be Thor and I'll be Odin[02:57.14]You rodent, I'm omnipotent[02:59.28]Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'[03:02.18]And I should not be woken[03:04.14]I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating[03:07.31]But I got your mom deep throating[03:08.87]I'm out my ramen noodle[03:12.55]We have nothing in common, poodle[03:13.55]I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil[03:15.30]It's me, my honesty's brutal[03:18.02]But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though[03:20.88]For good at least once in a while[03:23.18]So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle[03:26.02]Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times[03:29.52]But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned[03:31.18]Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime[03:33.55]I know there was a time where once I[03:35.31]Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind[03:38.53]So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine[03:40.28]Appeal with the skin color of mine[03:42.45]You get too big and here they come trying to censor you[03:44.25]Like that one line I said on \"I'm Back\" from the Marshall Mathers LP[03:47.56]One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine[03:50.39]Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine[03:54.17]See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal[04:00.26]You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though[04:02.59]And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for[04:04.49]You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows[04:07.03]You're like normal, fuck being normal[04:08.82]And I just bought a new Raygun from the future[04:10.87]To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad[04:13.40]Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad[04:16.25]Singin' to a man while they played piano[04:18.38]Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel[04:20.04]So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day[04:22.85]''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''[04:24.07]Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)[04:26.22]Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human[04:28.33]What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman[04:29.60]Innovative and I'm made of rubber[04:31.04]So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you[04:32.80]I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating[04:34.41]How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating[04:36.04]Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting[04:37.94]For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating[04:39.50]Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated[04:40.77]I make elevating music, you make elevator music[04:43.00]Oh, he's too mainstream[04:44.08]Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it[04:46.69]It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it[04:49.01]With rock, shock rap with Doc[04:51.02]Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it[04:52.90]I don't know how to make songs like that[04:54.22]I don't know what words to use[04:55.71]Let me know when it occurs to you[04:57.09]While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you[04:58.71]It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you[05:00.39]How many verses I gotta murder to prove[05:01.88]That if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too[05:05.53]School flunkie, pill junky[05:07.69]But look at the accolades the skills brung me[05:10.24]Full of myself, but still hungry[05:12.11]I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to[05:14.63]And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues[05:18.57]But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you[05:20.36]I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat[05:24.01]Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky[05:26.21]But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling[05:30.24]Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me[05:33.76]They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate[05:35.52]But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had[05:37.34]Then you may be a little patient and more symphatetic to the situation[05:40.50]And understand the discrimation[05:42.50]But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then[05:48.37]But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?[05:49.34]Don't mistake it for Satan[05:50.28]It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas[05:52.92]And take a vacation to trip a broad[05:54.25]And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard[05:56.97]Be a king? Think not—why be a king when you can be a God?",
